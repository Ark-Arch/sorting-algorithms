# sorting-algorithms
This repo contains a number of sorting algorithms (from basic ones to a bit more advanced)
P.S. these algorithms would be written in the c language.

TASK 1
- write a bubble sort algorithm for an array of numbers.
- should take in an input that tells the count of numbers intended to be sorted.
- it should of course then take in the numbers needed to be sorted.
- it should also be able to accomodate a user request for a descending or ascendiing order of sort.
- it should print back to the console an array.
- WRITE A GUI application accomodating the above instructions.
